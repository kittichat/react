***Login 
-Input cannot send data to backend but it can connect to backend
-remove package : axios-hook, cookie-client , namor , styled-component

Checkpoints:
-session id >> when i use 'test member' then logout session is gone but others still alive ?

Got some bug
-Listofgroup in CreateForm >> when i use django_db ; error shows Listofgroup is not a function but 
when i use django_project error was gone then i think this problem might be "map" function in ES6 it's null
