***Login 
-Input cannot send data to backend but it can connect to backend
-remove package : axios-hook, cookie-client , namor , styled-component

Checkpoints:
-session id >> when i use 'test member' then logout session is gone but others still alive ?

Got some bug
-Listofgroup in CreateForm >> when i use django_db ; error shows Listofgroup is not a function but 
when i use django_project error was gone then i think this problem might be "map" function in ES6 it's null

better check phone number in booking fucntion

Group detail
-set members to data variable

Header authentication
-when group detail page is requested, How do I know the one who request is
-authorized >> 0 or 1 check from cookie

Get members fucntion in Group services
-should gives authority to browser

dynamic court and time >> set variable to flexible

fixed user by identify from session not just header >> check both of these >> acttualy, this part it needs to check from both sides server and front-end (session and username)

function 
-notification Accept,Decline
-group "Role" ; if header then .. if member ..
-When retrieving a list of members checks privacy first is that the app allows it or not.  
1.name of key is public
2.don't forget to add feature of [add or delete] member if role is header. If role is member and group is public then member should have feature to join the group and if member is already one of group then they have privilege to leave from the group.

problem found
-I got some problem that Httpolny make me cannot get sessionID from storage
-At the part of react-table in groupdetail. I have some problem with data that use in react-table, First I try to handle data by myself and stuck. Now, I think the second way is get data from the server

function Create group
-create group >> without name of group, web app should not let user create group **
-notification message show >> correct grammar


Booking by Group 
flow of booking:
1.Check first are they header or not
2.if they are header then they have privilege to booking in group
